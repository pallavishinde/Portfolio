# Data Science Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my repository of data science projects. It is a compilation of projects completed as part of online courses or just plain old curiosity. 

*The data used in all projects is for demonstration purpose only. All projects are presented as Python Notebooks.*

#### **1. Visualizing Decision Boundaries for Iris Species**

This project explores the [Iris Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris?ref=datanews.io) and uses various classification algorithms to visualize decision boundaries. The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/pallavishinde/Portfolio/blob/master/Iris%20Dataset/EDA%2C%20Decision%20Boundaries%20%26%20Prediction%20with%20Iris%20Species%20Dataset.ipynb). 

<sub>*Tools: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn*</sub>

The data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

<sub>*Tools: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn*</sub>

#### **3. Exploratory data analysis of 911 calls**

This [notebook](https://github.com/pallavishinde/Portfolio/blob/master/911%20Emergency%20Calls/911%20Calls%20Data%20Capstone%20Project%20.ipynb) looks closely the [911 calls data](https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert/data) and using data manipulation and visualization gain a deeper understanding of the data. 

<sub>*Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn*</sub>

#### **4. Predicting House Prices using Regression**

Using the [Ames Housing Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) to create Regression model to predict house prices. The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/pallavishinde/Portfolio/blob/master/Boston%20Housing%20Dataset/Boston%20Housing%20Price%20Prediction%20(Stacked%20Regression).ipynb) and goes through data exploration, data munging and prediction modelling. 

<sub>*Tools: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn*</sub>

#### **5. Exploratory data analysis of Flights Delays in US**

This [notebook](https://github.com/pallavishinde/Portfolio/blob/master/Flights%20Delay%20Dataset/EDA%20%26%20Visualization%20-%20Flights%20Delay%20Dataset.ipynb) explores the flight delays dataset to understand the trend in flight delays from airports to total delay times. 

<sub>*Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn*</sub>

#### **6. Movies Recommender System**

Item based collaborative filtering to recommend movies to users based on user ratings. The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/pallavishinde/Portfolio/blob/master/Movie%20Recommender/Movie%20Recommender%20System%20-%20Movie%20Lens%20Data.ipynb).

<sub>*Tools: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn*</sub>

#### **7. Customer Segmentation for Wholesale customers**

Exploring the [Wholesale Customer dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers) to discover patterns and internal structure of the spending habits and create segments of different customer profiles. The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/pallavishinde/Portfolio/blob/master/Wholesale%20Customers%20Segmentation/Customer%20Segmentation%20-%20Wholesale%20Customers.ipynb).

<sub>*Tools: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn*</sub>

#### **8. 3-way Sentiment Analysis (NLP)**

This project explores the [Airline Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment/data) and attempts to do a 3-way polarity (positive, negative, neutral) classification system for tweets. It uses NLTK for pre-processing tweets. The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/pallavishinde/Portfolio/blob/master/Airline%20Reviews%20-%20Sentiment%20Analysis/Airline%20Reviews%20-%20Sentiment%20Analysis.ipynb). 

<sub>*Tools: Pandas, NLTK, Seaborn, Scikit-learn*</sub>

#### **9. Level Difficulty of Candy Crush Saga**

This project explores the data from the mobile hit game Candy Crush Saga and computes and analyses the level difficulty. The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/pallavishinde/Portfolio/blob/master/Level%20difficulty%20in%20Candy%20Crush%20Saga/Level%20Difficulty%20in%20Candy%20Crush%20Saga.ipynb). 

<sub>*Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn*</sub>

#### **10. Player Retention Analysis with AB Testing**

This project explores player retention for a mobile game through AB testing a new game feature. The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/pallavishinde/Portfolio/blob/master/Mobile%20Games%20Ab-testing%20with%20Cookie%20Cats/Analysing%20Player%20Retention%20with%20AB%20Testing%20.ipynb). 

<sub>*Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib*</sub>

#### **11. Exploring 67 years of LEGO**

This project explores the database of every Lego set ever built. The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/pallavishinde/Portfolio/blob/master/Exploring%2067%20years%20of%20LEGO/Exploring%2067%20years%20of%20Lego.ipynb). 

<sub>*Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib*</sub>

#### **12. Churn Prediction**

This project explores the data collected by a telecoms company and try to predict whether or not a person will churn. The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/pallavishinde/Portfolio/blob/master/Churn%20Prediction/Churn%20Prediction%20(Telecoms).ipynb). 

<sub>*Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn*</sub>

#### **13. Human vs. Bot Data Analysis**

This project explores the visitor logs, in particular the user agents, for a hotel search website. The aim of the project is to analyse how much traffic can be attributed to bots and humans. It also takes a closer look at the how the traffic differs based on the devices, brands, browsers and locations. The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/pallavishinde/Portfolio/blob/master/Bot%20vs.%20%20Human%20Data%20Analysis/Human%20and%20Bot%20Data.ipynb).
